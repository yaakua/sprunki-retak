## How to Play Smash Karts

### Battle and earn XP

Face off with other players in the arena for 3 or more minutes of kart-smashing mayhem. The game has several maps to explore, and it is actively updated with more. Each public game you play will give you XP, which you can then use to level up. 

Leveling up will reward you with coins, hats, wheels, and character tokens. You can use character tokens in the prize machine to unlock new characters with varying rarity levels.

### Pick up weapons

Drive over the boxes containing question marks to pick up random weapons and power-ups. You’ll find anything from invincibility to missiles, machine guns, and mines to use against your opponents. Get in your kart and cause some chaos!

### Customize your kart!

Choose between a selection of wacky little characters and karts. You can customize your kart and characters in the customize menu. There, you’ll find a selection of karts, characters, hats, and holiday items! Use your coins, character tokens, and gems to buy various in-game items.
